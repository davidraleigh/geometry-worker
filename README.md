Geometry worker for http://geometry.fogmodel.io

### RabbitMQ demo of the geometry-api-cs library
The code in this repo is a demonstration of how one could create a rabbitmq worker from the geometry-api-cs library. The geometry-api-cs library is based off of esri's [geometry-api-java](https://github.com/esri/geometry-api-java) library.

### Building a rabbitmq geometry-worker
The geometry-api-cs.dll geometry library is still under development so the dll is not yet publicly available. Contact me for information about the library if you're interested.
